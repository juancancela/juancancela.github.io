####Description
Software Integration Architect

####My Work
As Software Integration Architect at Level 3, my primary objective is to define both an integration strategy and a service oriented architecture, to integrate current Level 3 and Global Crossing software platforms, in order to provide support to newly required business processes.
Apart from integration tasks, I provide guidance on framework developing, as well as definition of architecture roadmap for different platforms.

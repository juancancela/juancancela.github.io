## Description

Toy Robot is a tiny JS project I have developed, that basically takes an input file with a sequence of movements, and tries to reach the exit of a labyrinth. 


## Installing Toy Robot

On application root path, run following command to download application dependencies:

{% highlight javascript %}
npm install
{% endhighlight %}


## Starting application

{% highlight javascript %}
npm start <FILE_PATH>
{% endhighlight %}


## Executing application unit tests

{% highlight javascript %}
npm test
{% endhighlight %}


## Checking application code coverage

{% highlight javascript %}
npm run coverage
{% endhighlight %}

## Running provided examples and additional data sets

* To run Example A (described in PROBLEM.md), execute:

<b>$ npm run example_a</b>

* To run Example B (described in PROBLEM.md), execute:

<b>$ npm run example_b</b>

* To run Example C (described in PROBLEM.md), execute:

<b>$ npm run example_c</b>

* To run additional set A, execute:

<b>$ npm run additional_a</b>

* To run additional set B, execute:

<b>$ npm run additional_b</b>
